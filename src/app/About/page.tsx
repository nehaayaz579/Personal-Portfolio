              About Me
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed text-purple-500">
              I completed my early education through the Sindh Board of Karachi,
              where I successfully passed my 9th and 10th-grade exams with an A1
              grade. Afterward, I pursued my intermediate education, earning a B
              grade. This foundation led me to further my studies at Karachi
              University, where I completed my Masterâ€™s in Applied Mathematics.
              During my time at university, I focused on Software Engineering as
              an optional subject and gained a deep understanding of
              programming, particularly Python. My passion for technology drove
              me to explore the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning. I
              attended seminars on these topics and earned certificates that
              further fueled my interest. Recently, I also participated in
              several hackathons, where I was able to apply my knowledge in
              practical, real-world scenarios. In addition to my academic
              journey, I took the opportunity to expand my skill set through
              various web development courses. I gained hands-on experience in
              HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js at
              GIAIC, where I also earned valuable insights into modern web
              technologies. My learning journey continues as I aim to enhance my
              skills and contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry.
